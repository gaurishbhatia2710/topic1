    <u><h1>Introduction</h1></u>
    <div class="Highlight">
      My name is Gaurish Bhatia(2110994762). I have completed SIT 123(Data
      capture and technologies) and SIT 210(Embedded Systems) and other units in the previous
      semesters, which introduced me to the world of IoT.Now, in this semester, I am aiming for High Distinction in this
      unit. In this webpage, one can have a look about the different activities
      we discussed about in the seminar.
